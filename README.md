The Squirrel Tracker aims to keep track of all the known squirrels and start with Central Park. 
We build this application based on Django that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow users to add, update, and view squirrel data.

Squirrel Tracker has the following features:
1. Import the data from file in CSV format 
2. Export the data in CSV format
3. Display map that shows the location of the squirrel sightings
4. List all squirrel sightings with links to view each sighting
5. Update a particular sighting and create a new sighting
6. View general stats about the sightings
